# Game Development with Python

This is information and example code written for a talk I did at
the Greenville Python Meetup in May of 2019.

## Examples

### Asteroids

A basic version of Asteroids, this game showcases some basics of the Arcade
library like subclassing the `Window` class, keyboard input handling and
drawing basic shapes.

#### Further Ideas

- Sound
- Player max speed
- Enemy ships
- Wrap bullets when they go off screen (like the player ship does)
- Use sprites instead of shapes
- Player lives
- Glorious explosion when player ship explodes
- Keep score
- "Game Over" handling
- Game menus and make it so you can start a new game without re-running the app
- Optimize drawing requests

### Minesweeper

Shows mouse interaction, text drawing, and using sprites for drawing.

#### Further Ideas

- UI to select difficulty
- Allow resizing the window

### Sokoban
